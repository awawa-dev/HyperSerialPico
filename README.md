# HyperSerialPico
Adalight serial port LED driver implementation for Raspberry Pi Pico RP2040.

# Recommended boards with a built-in level shifter
To ensure the LEDs will work properly with the Pico board, a 3.3V to 5V level shifter is needed. You can use an external one e.g. SN74AHCT125N or just buy a model of rp2040 that already has it built-in: Adafruit Feather RP2040 Scorpio (output: GPIO16-23), Pimoroni Plasma 2040 (GPIO14-15) or Pimoroni Plasma Stick 2040 W (GPIO15).

# Supported LED strips
| LED strip / Device             |    Single lane   |    Multi-segment   |
|--------------------------------|:----------------:|:------------------:|
| SK6812 cold white              |       yes        |        yes         |
| SK6812 neutral white           |       yes        |        yes         |
| WS281x                         |       yes        |        yes         |
| SPI (APA102, SK9812, HD107...) |       yes        |        no*         |

`*` you don't need parallel mode for SPI LEDs, they are already using high speed 10Mb internal data line

# How to flash it?
It's very easy and you don't need any special flasher.  

First download the firmware directly from the [Release folder](https://github.com/awawa-dev/HyperSerialPico/releases).  

For HyperHDR choose `HyperSerialPico_<type>.uf2` firmware where *type* is one of supported LEDs: sk6812 cold/neutral white, variants of ws2812 and apa102. If you are using an application other than HyperHDR, select the `classic_adalight.zip` archive, unzip it and select `classic_adalight_HyperSerialPico_<type>.uf2` firmware (note: do not use firmwares from this archive for HyperHDR, they do not support my AWA protocol extension, missing many options and are simply only backwards compatible with other applications).  
  
Next put your Pico board into DFU mode:  
* If your Pico board has only one button (`boot`) then press & hold it and connect the board to the USB port. Then you can release the button.
* If your Pico board has two buttons, connect it to the USB port. Then press & hold `boot` and `reset` buttons, then release `reset` and next release `boot` button.  

In the system file explorer you should find new drive (e.g. called `RPI-RP2` drive) exposed by the Pico board. Drag & drop (or copy) the selected firmware to this drive. 
The Pico will reset automaticly after the upload and after few seconds it will be ready to use by HyperHDR as a serial port device using Adalight driver.

# HyperHDR configuration
You need HyperHDR v20 or newer. Make sure you have enabled `AWA protocol` and `Esp8266/ESP32/Rp2040 handshake` options. You can leave the speed at `2000000` because the CDC driver should use the highest possible speed automatically (at least it happens on Windows).

# Default pinout
  
**LED output (SK6812/WS281x):** GPIO2 for Data    
**LED output (SPI LEDs):** GPIO3 for Data, GPIO2 for Clock  

If multi-segment mode is enabled for SK6812/WS281x, the output for the second segment is always the next GPIO pin (`OUTPUT_DATA_PIN` + 1).

rp2040 allows hardware SPI on corresponding pairs of pins:  
spi0 ⇒ Data/Clock: GPIO3/GPIO2, GPIO19/GPIO18, GPIO7/GPIO6  
spi1 ⇒ Data/Clock: GPIO11/GPIO10, GPI15/GPIO14, GPIO27/GPI26  

Pinout can be changed, but you need to make changes to `CMakeList.txt` (e.g. `OUTPUT_DATA_PIN` / `OUTPUT_SPI_DATA_PIN` / `OUTPUT_SPI_CLOCK_PIN`) and recompile the project. Also multi-segment mode can be enabled in this file: `SECOND_SEGMENT_INDEX` option at the beginning and optionally `SECOND_SEGMENT_REVERSED`. Once compiled, the results can be found in the `firmwares` folder.

Of course, you can also build your custom firmware completely online using Github Actions. The manual can be found on [wiki](https://github.com/awawa-dev/HyperSerialPico/wiki). Be sure to follow the steps in the correct order.
